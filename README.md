# SpringBootMallProject



### Introduction:

 This demo project is base on:

#### Backend:

**Spring Boot** and **MySQL** with **MyBatis** for simplifying SQL operations. **Maven** is used to build and manage the project and **Log4j2** for logging which has better performance than Logback. For frontend, **redis** is used for caching which saves a lot of time for front end users.

Some parts are unfinished yet.

#### Frontend :

Unfinished yet.

#### Future plan:

Both parts are not finished yet but will be done in next few days.  This project will run on a server with a website. After finishing, I will post the address of the website in documentation as well.
