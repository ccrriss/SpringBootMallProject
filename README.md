# SpringBootMallProject



### Introduction:

 This demo project is base on:

#### Backend:

**Spring Boot** and **MySQL** with **MyBatis** for simplifying SQL operations. **Maven** is used to build and manage the project and **Log4j2** for logging which has better performance than Logback. For frontend, **redis** is used for caching which saves a lot of time for front end users.

**PostMan** is used for testing backend APIs.

#### Server:
